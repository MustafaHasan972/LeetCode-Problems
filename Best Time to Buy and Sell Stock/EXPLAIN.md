**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling a single stock represented by a series of daily `prices`.

**2. Variables Initialization:**

- `minPrice` is initialized to `Infinity`. It will be used to keep track of the minimum stock price encountered during the iteration.
- `maxProfit` is initialized to `0`. It will store the maximum profit that can be obtained.

**3. Loop through Prices:**

- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the `prices` array.

**4. Check if Current Price is Lower:**

- Inside the loop, it checks if the current `prices[i]` is lower than the `minPrice`. If it is, it updates `minPrice` to the current `prices[i]`. This step helps identify the minimum price encountered so far.

**5. Calculate Potential Profit:**

- If the current `prices[i]` is not lower than `minPrice`, it calculates the potential profit that can be obtained by selling the stock at the current price. The potential profit is calculated as `prices[i] - minPrice`.

**6. Update Max Profit:**

- If the potential profit (`prices[i] - minPrice`) is greater than the current `maxProfit`, it updates `maxProfit` with this potential profit. This step ensures that `maxProfit` always holds the maximum profit encountered during the iteration.

**7. Return Max Profit:**

- After completing the loop, the code returns `maxProfit`, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock once.

**8. Overall Functionality:**

- The code efficiently iterates through the `prices` array, keeping track of the minimum price and updating the maximum profit as it goes along. This approach ensures that it finds the maximum profit in a single pass through the array.
