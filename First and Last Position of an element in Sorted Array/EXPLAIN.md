**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to find the range of indices in the sorted array `nums` where the target element `target` appears. Specifically, it returns the first and last indices where `target` is found.

**2. Variables Initialization:**

- `first` and `last` are initialized to `-1`. These variables will store the indices of the first and last occurrences of the `target` element.
- `left` is initialized to `0`, representing the left boundary of the search range.
- `right` is initialized to `nums.length - 1`, representing the right boundary of the search range.

**3. First Binary Search Loop:**

- The code enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the `mid` index as the average of `left` and `right`.
- It compares the element at `mid` in the `nums` array to the `target`.
- If `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`, it means a possible first occurrence is found:
  - `first` is set to `mid`.
  - The `right` boundary is adjusted to `mid - 1` to search for the leftmost occurrence of `target`.
- If `nums[mid]` is less than `target`, it means the target must be on the right side of `mid`, so `left` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- If `nums[mid]` is greater than `target`, it means the target must be on the left side of `mid`, so `right` is updated to `mid - 1`.

**4. Second Binary Search Loop:**

- After completing the first loop, the code resets `left` to `0` and `right` to `nums.length - 1` to search for the last occurrence.
- It enters another `while` loop with a similar structure as the first loop.
- In this loop, it again calculates the `mid` index and compares `nums[mid]` to `target`.
- If `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`, it means a possible last occurrence is found:
  - `last` is set to `mid`.
  - The `left` boundary is adjusted to `mid + 1` to search for the rightmost occurrence of `target`.
- If `nums[mid]` is less than `target`, it updates `left` to `mid + 1`.
- If `nums[mid]` is greater than `target`, it updates `right` to `mid - 1`.

**5. Return the Result:**

- After both loops finish, the code returns `[first, last]`, which contains the indices of the first and last occurrences of the `target` element in the `nums` array.

**6. Overall Functionality:**

- This code effectively utilizes binary search to find the first and last occurrences of the `target` element in a sorted array, providing a time-efficient solution to the problem.
