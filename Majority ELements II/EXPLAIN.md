**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to find elements in an array that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times, where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

**2. Initial Declarations:**

- Two variables, `candidate1` and `candidate2`, are initialized to `null`. These variables will store the potential majority elements.
- Two variables, `count1` and `count2`, are initialized to `0`. These variables will keep track of how many times `candidate1` and `candidate2` occur.

**3. Loop through the Array:**

- The code iterates through each element (`num`) in the `nums` array.
- It checks if `num` matches with either `candidate1` or `candidate2`.
  - If it matches with `candidate1`, `count1` is incremented.
  - If it matches with `candidate2`, `count2` is incremented.
- If `num` doesn't match with either candidate, it checks if `count1` is `0`.
  - If `count1` is `0`, it assigns `num` to `candidate1` and sets `count1` to `1`.
  - If `count1` is not `0` but `count2` is `0`, it assigns `num` to `candidate2` and sets `count2` to `1`.
  - If both `count1` and `count2` are not `0`, it decrements both `count1` and `count2`.

**4. Validate Candidates:**

- After processing the array, the code resets `count1` and `count2` to `0`.
- It iterates through the array again to count the occurrences of `candidate1` and `candidate2`.

**5. Result Calculation:**

- The code initializes an empty array `result` to store the final result.
- If `count1` is greater than `nums.length / 3`, it means that `candidate1` occurs more than ⌊n/3⌋ times, so it is added to the `result` array.
- Similarly, if `count2` is greater than `nums.length / 3`, `candidate2` is added to the `result` array.

**6. Return the Result:**

- Finally, the code returns the `result` array, which contains the majority elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times in the input array `nums`.
