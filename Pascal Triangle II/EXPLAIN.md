**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to generate and return the `rowIndex`-th row of Pascal's Triangle as an array.

**2. Check for Negative `rowIndex`:**

- The code begins with a check to ensure that the provided `rowIndex` is not negative. If `rowIndex` is negative, an empty array is returned since there's no valid row in Pascal's Triangle for a negative index.

**3. Initialize the First Row:**

- The variable `row` is initialized as an array containing a single element, `1`. This represents the first row of Pascal's Triangle.

**4. Generate Subsequent Rows:**

- The code enters a loop that runs from `1` to `rowIndex` (inclusive). This loop generates each subsequent row of Pascal's Triangle.

**5. Generate a New Row:**

- Inside the loop, a new array called `newRow` is created, and it starts with the value `1`, representing the leftmost element of the row.

**6. Calculate Intermediate Values:**

- A nested loop runs to calculate the intermediate values of the new row. It starts from `1` to `row.length - 1` (since the first element of the new row is already set to `1`).

**7. Populate `newRow`:**

- For each index `j` in the nested loop, the code calculates the value at index `j` in the new row by adding the values at indices `j - 1` and `j` from the previous row (`row[j - 1] + row[j]`).
- These intermediate values are pushed into `newRow` to complete the row.

**8. Set the Last Element of `newRow`:**

- The rightmost element of the new row is set to `1` to complete the row.

**9. Clear and Copy `newRow` to `row`:**

- The original `row` is cleared (its length is set to `0`), and the values from `newRow` are copied into `row` using the spread operator `...`.
- This step prepares `row` for the next iteration to generate the next row.

**10. Repeat Until `rowIndex` Rows Are Generated:** - The loop repeats until the desired `rowIndex` rows are generated.

**11. Return the Resulting Row:** - Once all rows are generated, the code returns the `row`, which now contains the `rowIndex`-th row of Pascal's Triangle.

**12. Overall Functionality:** - The code constructs each row of Pascal's Triangle by generating a new row based on the previous row's values. It iterates from the first row to the specified `rowIndex`, creating each row in sequence.
