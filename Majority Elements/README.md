# Majority Element in JavaScript

This JavaScript code defines a function `majorityElement` that finds the majority element in an array of numbers. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, where n is the length of the array. This code uses a voting algorithm to efficiently find the majority element. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `majorityElement` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Create an array `nums` containing the numbers in which you want to find the majority element.

3. Call the `majorityElement` function with the `nums` array as an argument.

```javascript
const nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2];
const result = majorityElement(nums);
```

4. The function will return the majority element found in the `nums` array.

```javascript
console.log(`Majority Element: ${result}`);
```

## Function Description

The `majorityElement` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the majority element in an array of numbers.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The array of numbers.
 * @return {number} - The majority element.
 */
var majorityElement = function (nums) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
};
```

The function takes one argument:

- `nums`: The array of numbers in which to find the majority element.

The function returns the majority element found in the `nums` array.

## Algorithm Explanation

The code uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to efficiently find the majority element in the array. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize two variables: `candidate` and `count`. The `candidate` variable represents the current candidate for the majority element, and `count` represents the count of that candidate.

2. Iterate through the `nums` array using a `for...of` loop.

3. For each element `num` in the array:

   - If `count` is `0`, set `candidate` to `num` (assign the current element as the candidate).
   - If `candidate` is equal to `num`, increment `count` by `1`.
   - If `candidate` is not equal to `num`, decrement `count` by `1`.

   The key idea here is that the `candidate` and `count` are used to keep track of a potential majority element. When `count` reaches `0`, it means that the current candidate does not dominate the remaining part of the array, so we switch to a new candidate. The majority element, if it exists, will remain as the final candidate.

4. After iterating through the entire array, the `candidate` variable will hold the majority element.

5. Return the `candidate` as the majority element.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `majorityElement` function:

```javascript
const nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2];
const result = majorityElement(nums);

console.log(`Majority Element: ${result}`);
```

In this example, the `majorityElement` function is called with the `nums` array `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`. After processing, the function returns the majority element, which is `2`.
