**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks represented by daily `prices`.

**2. Initialize Variables:**

- `profit` is initialized to `0`. It will store the maximum profit that can be obtained.

**3. Loop through Prices:**

- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the `prices` array, starting from the second element (`i = 1`).

**4. Check for Profitable Transactions:**

- Inside the loop, it checks if the current `prices[i]` is greater than the previous day's price (`prices[i - 1]`).
- If `prices[i]` is greater than `prices[i - 1]`, it means a profitable transaction could be made by buying on day `i - 1` and selling on day `i`.

**5. Calculate and Add Profit:**

- When a profitable transaction is identified, it calculates the profit by subtracting the previous day's price (`prices[i - 1]`) from the current day's price (`prices[i]`).
- The calculated profit is added to the `profit` variable.

**6. Continue Looping:**

- The loop continues to the next day (`i++`) and repeats the process.

**7. Return Max Profit:**

- After completing the loop, the code returns `profit`, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained by making profitable transactions based on the given `prices`.

**8. Example Usage:**

- The code is tested with an example array `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`.
- It calculates the maximum profit as `7` since there are two profitable transactions (buying at `1` and selling at `5`, and buying at `3` and selling at `6`).

**9. Overall Functionality:**

- This code efficiently iterates through the `prices` array and calculates the maximum profit by adding up the profits obtained from each profitable transaction.
