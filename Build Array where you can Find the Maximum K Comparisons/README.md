# Count Valid Arrays in JavaScript

This JavaScript code defines a function `numOfArrays` that counts the number of arrays of length `n` containing integers from `1` to `m` such that the sum of the elements in the array is equal to `k`. The function returns the count of valid arrays that satisfy these conditions. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `numOfArrays` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Call the `numOfArrays` function with three arguments:
   - `n`: The length of the array.
   - `m`: The maximum value allowed in the array (from `1` to `m`).
   - `k`: The target sum of elements in the array.

```javascript
const n = 3;
const m = 3;
const k = 3;
const result = numOfArrays(n, m, k);
console.log(result); // Output: 27
```

3. After calling the function, it will return the count of valid arrays that satisfy the specified conditions.

## Function Description

The `numOfArrays` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the number of arrays of length 'n' containing integers from 1 to 'm' such that
 * the sum of the elements in the array is equal to 'k'.
 *
 * @param {number} n - The length of the array.
 * @param {number} m - The maximum value allowed in the array (from 1 to 'm').
 * @param {number} k - The target sum of elements in the array.
 * @return {number} - Returns the number of arrays that satisfy the conditions.
 */
const numOfArrays = function (n, m, k) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
};
```

The function takes three arguments:

- `n`: The length of the array.
- `m`: The maximum value allowed in the array (from `1` to `m`).
- `k`: The target sum of elements in the array.

The function returns the count of valid arrays that satisfy the specified conditions.

## Algorithm Explanation

The `numOfArrays` function uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid arrays. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize dynamic programming arrays (`dp`) and prefix arrays (`prefix`) for storing intermediate results. These arrays have dimensions `(m + 1) x (k + 1)`.

2. Initialize base cases for `n=1`. For each value from `1` to `m`, set the corresponding elements in `prevDp` and `prevPrefix` to `1`. These represent the valid arrays of length `1` with the given constraints.

3. Loop for each value of `n` from `2` to `n`.

4. For each possible maximum number `maxNum` from `1` to `m` and each possible cost `cost` from `1` to `k`, calculate the number of valid arrays with these conditions:

   - `dp[maxNum][cost]`: The number of valid arrays with the maximum number `maxNum` and the cost `cost`. It is calculated based on the previous values.
   - If both `maxNum` and `cost` are greater than `1`, add the previous prefix value (`prevPrefix[maxNum - 1][cost - 1]`) to `dp[maxNum][cost]`.

5. Calculate the current prefix sum (`prefix[maxNum][cost]`) based on the updated `dp` values.

6. Update the `prevDp` and `prevPrefix` arrays for the next iteration.

7. The final result is stored in the prefix array at position `[m][k]`, which represents the number of valid arrays of length `n` with the given constraints.

8. Return the final result as the count of valid arrays.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `numOfArrays` function:

```javascript
const n = 3;
const m = 3;
const k = 3;
const result = numOfArrays(n, m, k);
console.log(result); // Output: 27
```

In this example, the `numOfArrays` function is called with `n` equal to `3`, `m` equal to `3`, and `k` equal to `3`. The function calculates and returns the count of valid arrays of length `3` with integers from `1` to `3` whose elements sum to `3`, which is `27`.
