**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to calculate the number of arrays of length `n`, where each element in the array is less than or equal to `m`, and the sum of the elements in the array is exactly `k`.

**2. Constants and Arrays Initialization:**

- `mod` is defined as `1e9 + 7`, which is used for modulo arithmetic.
- Several arrays are initialized:
  - `dp` is a 2D array with dimensions `(m + 1) x (k + 1)`.
  - `prefix` is another 2D array with the same dimensions.
  - `prevDp` and `prevPrefix` are also initialized similarly.

**3. Initialization of `prevDp` and `prevPrefix`:**

- A loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = m`, setting the initial values for `prevDp` and `prevPrefix`:
  - `prevDp[j][1]` is set to `1`.
  - `prevPrefix[j][1]` is set to `j`.

**4. Main Loop (Outermost Loop - `_`):**

- An outer loop runs from `_ = 2` to `_ = n`. This loop represents the length of the arrays we are generating.

**5. Nested Loops (maxNum and cost):**

- Inside the main loop, there are two nested loops.
- The first nested loop runs through `maxNum` from `1` to `m`. It represents the maximum number allowed in the array.
- The second nested loop runs through `cost` from `1` to `k`. It represents the target sum `k`.

**6. Calculating `dp[maxNum][cost]`:**

- The code calculates `dp[maxNum][cost]` as `(maxNum * prevDp[maxNum][cost]) % mod`. This step computes the number of arrays ending with `maxNum` and having a sum of `cost`.

**7. Updating `dp[maxNum][cost]` with Prefix Sums:**

- If `maxNum` is greater than `1` and `cost` is greater than `1`, it updates `dp[maxNum][cost]` by adding `prevPrefix[maxNum - 1][cost - 1]` modulo `mod`. This step considers arrays where the last element is `maxNum` and the sum of the previous elements is `cost - 1`.

**8. Updating `prefix[maxNum][cost]`:**

- The code updates `prefix[maxNum][cost]` by adding `dp[maxNum][cost]` to `prefix[maxNum - 1][cost]` modulo `mod`. This step keeps track of the cumulative sum of arrays ending with `maxNum` and having a sum of `cost`.

**9. Updating `prevDp` and `prevPrefix`:**

- At the end of each iteration of the main loop, `prevDp` and `prevPrefix` are updated with the values of `dp` and `prefix`, respectively.

**10. Final Result:**

- After the main loop completes, the function returns `prefix[m][k]`, which represents the total number of arrays of length `n`, with elements less than or equal to `m`, and a sum of `k`.
