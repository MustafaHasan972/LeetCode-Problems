# Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero

This JavaScript code defines a function `minOperations` that calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce the sum of elements in an array `nums` to a specific target value `x`. The operations involve removing a contiguous subarray from the beginning or end of the array. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `minOperations` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Import or require the function in your project.

```javascript
// Import the minOperations function
const minOperations = require("./minOperations.js"); // Modify the path accordingly
```

3. Create an array `nums` and specify the target sum `x` that you want to reduce the array's sum to.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3];
const x = 5;
```

4. Call the `minOperations` function with the array and target sum as arguments.

```javascript
const result = minOperations(nums, x);
```

5. The function will return the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the sum of elements in the array to the target value.

```javascript
console.log(`Minimum operations to reduce sum to ${x}: ${result}`);
```

## Function Description

The `minOperations` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the minimum number of operations to reduce the sum of elements in the array `nums` to the target `x`.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - An array of integers.
 * @param {number} x - The target sum.
 * @return {number} The minimum number of operations, or -1 if it's not possible.
 */
function minOperations(nums, x) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
}
```

The function takes an array of integers `nums` and a target sum `x` as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to reduce the sum of elements in the array to the target `x`. If it's not possible to achieve the target sum, the function returns -1.

## Algorithm Explanation

The code implements the algorithm as follows:

1. Calculate the `total` sum of all elements in the input array `nums`.

2. Determine the `target` sum by subtracting `x` from the `total`. This is the sum that needs to be obtained by removing elements from `nums`.

3. Initialize pointers `left` and `right` to the beginning of the array. Also, initialize `currSum` to 0 and `minOps` to positive infinity. These variables will be used to keep track of the current sum and the minimum operations, respectively.

4. Iterate through the array using the `right` pointer. For each iteration, add the element at the `right` pointer to `currSum`.

5. While `currSum` is greater than the `target` and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, subtract the element at the `left` pointer from `currSum` and increment `left`. This step is used to minimize the sum and reduce it to the target.

6. If `currSum` becomes equal to the `target`, calculate the number of operations needed to achieve this by subtracting `(right - left + 1)` from the total number of elements in `nums`. Update `minOps` with the minimum of its current value and the calculated operations.

7. Continue the iteration, and at the end of the loop, `minOps` will hold the minimum operations required to reduce the sum to the target. If `minOps` is still positive infinity, it means it's not possible to achieve the target sum, so return -1. Otherwise, return `minOps` as the result.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `minOperations` function:

```javascript
const nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3];
const x = 5;
const result = minOperations(nums, x);
console.log(`Minimum operations to reduce sum to ${x}: ${result}`);
```

In this example, the function would return `2` because you can obtain the target sum of `5` by removing the subarray `[4, 2]`, resulting in the array `[1, 1, 3]`.
