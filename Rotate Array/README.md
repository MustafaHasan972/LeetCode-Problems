# Rotate Array in JavaScript

This JavaScript code defines a function `rotate` that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps `k`. The rotation is done in-place, meaning the original array is modified to achieve the rotation. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `rotate` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Call the `rotate` function with two arguments:
   - `nums`: An array of integers that you want to rotate.
   - `k`: The number of steps to rotate the array to the right.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k = 3;
rotate(nums, k);
```

3. After calling the function, the `nums` array will be modified to have its elements rotated to the right by `k` steps.

```javascript
console.log(nums); // Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

## Function Description

The `rotate` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Rotates the elements of an array 'nums' to the right by 'k' steps.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - An array of integers.
 * @param {number} k - The number of steps to rotate the array to the right.
 * @return {void} - Modifies the 'nums' array in-place.
 */
var rotate = function (nums, k) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
};
```

The function takes two arguments:

- `nums`: An array of integers that you want to rotate.
- `k`: The number of steps to rotate the array to the right.

The function modifies the `nums` array in-place, and there is no return value.

## Algorithm Explanation

The `rotate` function uses a series of array reversing operations to achieve the desired rotation. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. To handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the `nums` array, take the modulus of `k` by the length of the array. This ensures that `k` is within the range of valid indices.

2. Define a helper function `reverse` that takes two indices `i` and `j` and reverses the elements in the subarray `[i, j]` in the `nums` array. This helper function is used later to perform array reversing operations.

3. Reverse the entire `nums` array using the `reverse` function. This step effectively shifts all elements to the right.

4. Reverse the first `k` elements in the `nums` array using the `reverse` function. This step moves the first `k` elements to the end of the array, achieving the desired rotation.

5. Reverse the remaining elements in the `nums` array after the first `k` elements. This step completes the rotation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `rotate` function:

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k = 3;
rotate(nums, k);

console.log(nums); // Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

In this example, the `rotate` function is called with the `nums` array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k` equal to `3`. After calling the function, the `nums` array is modified to have its elements rotated to the right by `3` steps, resulting in `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
