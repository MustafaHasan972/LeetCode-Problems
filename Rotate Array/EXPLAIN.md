**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to rotate an array `nums` to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the array.

**2. Calculate Effective Rotation:**

- The code first calculates the effective rotation by taking the modulus (`%`) of `k` with the length of the `nums` array. This is done to handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array. The result is stored in the variable `k`.

**3. Reverse Function:**

- The code defines a helper function called `reverse` that takes two indices, `i` and `j`, as parameters.
- Within the `reverse` function, it uses a while loop to swap elements in the `nums` array between indices `i` and `j`, effectively reversing the elements within that range.

**4. Rotate in Three Steps:**

- The code performs the rotation in three steps:
  1.  It reverses the entire `nums` array using the `reverse` function with `i` starting at `0` and `j` ending at `nums.length - 1`. This effectively reverses the entire array.
  2.  It reverses the first `k` elements of the reversed array by calling `reverse(0, k - 1)`. This step rotates the first part of the array.
  3.  It reverses the remaining elements (last `nums.length - k` elements) by calling `reverse(k, nums.length - 1)`. This step rotates the second part of the array.

**5. Array Rotation Complete:**

- After these three steps, the `nums` array is effectively rotated to the right by `k` steps in-place.

**6. Example Output:**

- `console.log(rotate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3));` will not return anything explicitly, but it will modify the `nums` array in-place. After rotation, the `nums` array will be `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
