# Minimum Operations to Make an Array Continuous

The JavaScript code defines a function `minOperations` that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make an array continuous. The array `nums` is given as input, and the function determines the minimum number of operations needed to transform the array into a continuous sequence.

## Usage

To use the `minOperations` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Call the `minOperations` function with one argument:
   - `nums`: An array of integers representing the input array.

```javascript
const nums = [4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2];
const minOperationsCount = minOperations(nums);
console.log(minOperationsCount); // Output: 5
```

3. After calling the function, it will return the minimum number of operations required to make the array continuous.

## Function Description

The `minOperations` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the minimum number of operations required to make an array continuous.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - An array of integers.
 * @return {number} - Returns the minimum number of operations needed.
 */
function minOperations(nums) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
}
```

The function takes an array `nums` containing integers and returns the minimum number of operations required to make the array continuous.

## Algorithm Explanation

The `minOperations` function follows these steps to calculate the minimum number of operations:

1. Create a `Set` named `uniqueSet` to store unique elements from the input array `nums`.

2. Iterate through the `nums` array and add each element to `uniqueSet`. This step removes duplicate elements.

3. Convert the `uniqueSet` back to an array `uniqueNums`, sorted in ascending order using a custom sorting function.

4. Initialize variables `left` and `right` to zero and `maxContinuous` to zero.

5. Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum continuous subarray in `uniqueNums`. The sliding window starts at index `left` and expands to the right as long as the difference between the values at `right` and `left` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. The maximum continuous subarray length is stored in `maxContinuous`.

6. Calculate the minimum number of operations as `n - maxContinuous`, where `n` is the length of the input array.

7. Return the result, which represents the minimum number of operations required to make the array continuous.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `minOperations` function:

```javascript
const nums = [4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2];
const minOperationsCount = minOperations(nums);
console.log(minOperationsCount); // Output: 5
```

In this example, the `minOperations` function is called with an array of integers `nums`. The function calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make the array continuous. The result, `3`, indicates that three operations are required to transform the array into a continuous sequence.
