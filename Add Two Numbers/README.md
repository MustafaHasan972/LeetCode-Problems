# Adding Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists

This JavaScript code defines a function `addTwoNumbers` that adds two numbers represented as linked lists. Each node in the linked list represents a digit of the number, with the least significant digit at the head. The code performs the addition in a way that accounts for carry digits and creates a new linked list to represent the result. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `addTwoNumbers` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Create two linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) to represent the two numbers you want to add.

   - Each linked list should be defined using the `ListNode` constructor. Each node represents a digit, and the order of nodes corresponds to the order of digits in the number.

   - For example, to represent the number 123, you would create a linked list with three nodes: 3 -> 2 -> 1.

3. Call the `addTwoNumbers` function with the two linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) as arguments.

```javascript
const result = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2);
```

4. The function will return a new linked list representing the result of adding the two numbers.

5. You can traverse the resulting linked list to obtain the sum.

## Function Description

The `addTwoNumbers` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers represented by linked lists.
 *
 * @param {ListNode} l1 - The head of the first linked list representing a number.
 * @param {ListNode} l2 - The head of the second linked list representing a number.
 * @return {ListNode} - The head of the resulting linked list representing the sum.
 */
var addTwoNumbers = function (l1, l2) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
};
```

The function takes two linked lists `l1` and `l2` as input and returns a new linked list representing the sum of the two numbers.

## Algorithm Explanation

The code uses a straightforward algorithm to add two numbers represented by linked lists. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize variables `carry` to 0. This variable will hold the carry digit from one place to the next.

2. Create a dummy node (`dummy`) to simplify the logic. The `current` variable is used to traverse the result linked list, starting from the dummy node.

3. Use a `while` loop to iterate until both `l1` and `l2` are null, and there's no carry left.

4. Inside the loop, calculate the sum of the current digits and the carry (`sum = carry`).

   - If `l1` is not null, add its value to `sum` and move `l1` to the next node.

   - If `l2` is not null, add its value to `sum` and move `l2` to the next node.

5. Calculate the carry for the next iteration by dividing `sum` by 10 and taking the floor (`carry = Math.floor(sum / 10)`).

6. Calculate the value for the current node of the result linked list as the remainder of `sum` when divided by 10 (`sum %= 10`).

7. Create a new node with the calculated value and set it as the next node of the `current` node in the result linked list. Move the `current` pointer to the newly created node.

8. Continue the loop until both input linked lists are null, and there's no carry left.

9. After the loop, the `dummy` node represents the head of the result linked list. Return `dummy.next` to skip the dummy node and return the actual result.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `addTwoNumbers` function:

```javascript
const l1 = new ListNode(2, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(3))); // Represents the number 342
const l2 = new ListNode(5, new ListNode(6, new ListNode(4))); // Represents the number 465

const result = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2); // Should return a linked list representing the number 807
```

In this example, the `addTwoNumbers` function takes two linked lists `l1` and `l2`, each representing a number, and returns a new linked list representing their sum, which is the number 807.
