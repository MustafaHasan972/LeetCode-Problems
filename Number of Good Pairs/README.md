# Counting Identical Pairs in an Array

This JavaScript code defines a function `numIdenticalPairs` that counts the number of identical pairs in an array `nums`. The code uses nested loops to compare all pairs of elements in the array and increments a counter whenever identical elements are found. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `numIdenticalPairs` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Create an array `nums` for which you want to count identical pairs.

3. Call the `numIdenticalPairs` function with the `nums` array as an argument.

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3];
const result = numIdenticalPairs(nums);
```

4. The function will return the count of identical pairs in the `nums` array.

```javascript
console.log(`Number of identical pairs: ${result}`);
```

## Function Description

The `numIdenticalPairs` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the number of identical pairs in an array.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The array in which to count identical pairs.
 * @return {number} - The count of identical pairs.
 */
var numIdenticalPairs = (nums) => {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
};
```

The function takes one argument:

- `nums`: The array in which to count identical pairs.

The function calculates and returns the count of identical pairs in the `nums` array.

## Algorithm Explanation

The code uses a nested loop to compare all pairs of elements in the `nums` array and count the number of identical pairs. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the count of identical pairs.

2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the elements of the `nums` array. The outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element (`i`), and the inner loop iterates from the element following the current outer loop element to the last element (`j`).

3. In each iteration of the inner loop, compare `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. If they are equal, increment the `count` variable by 1. This step counts a pair of identical elements.

4. After processing all pairs of elements, return the value of `count`, which represents the total count of identical pairs in the `nums` array.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `numIdenticalPairs` function:

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3];
const result = numIdenticalPairs(nums);

console.log(`Number of identical pairs: ${result}`);
```

In this example, the `numIdenticalPairs` function is called with the `nums` array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3]`. After processing, the function returns the count of identical pairs, which is `4`. The output is displayed as "Number of identical pairs: 4."
