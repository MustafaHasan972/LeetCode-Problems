# Integer Break in JavaScript

This JavaScript code defines a function `integerBreak` that calculates the maximum product of integers obtained by breaking a given positive integer `n` into smaller positive integers. The goal is to find the maximum product by breaking `n` into at least two positive integers and then multiplying those integers together. This code uses dynamic programming to efficiently solve this problem. This README.md file provides an overview of the code and how to use it.

## Usage

To use the `integerBreak` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the code snippet in your JavaScript project.

2. Call the `integerBreak` function with a positive integer `n` as an argument.

```javascript
const n = 10;
const result = integerBreak(n);
```

3. The function will return the maximum product of integers obtained by breaking the input integer `n` into smaller positive integers.

```javascript
console.log(`Maximum Product: ${result}`);
```

## Function Description

The `integerBreak` function is defined as follows:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the maximum product of integers obtained by breaking a given positive integer `n` into smaller positive integers.
 *
 * @param {number} n - The positive integer `n`.
 * @return {number} - The maximum product.
 */
var integerBreak = function (n) {
  // ... (code implementation as described in the code snippet)
};
```

The function takes one argument:

- `n`: The positive integer `n` to be broken into smaller positive integers.

The function returns the maximum product of integers obtained by breaking the input integer `n`.

## Algorithm Explanation

The code uses dynamic programming to find the maximum product. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize an array `dp` of length `n + 1` and fill it with zeros. `dp[i]` represents the maximum product for the integer `i`.

2. Set `dp[1]` to `1` since the maximum product for `1` is `1`.

3. Iterate through the integers from `2` to `n` (inclusive) using a loop:

   - For each integer `i`, iterate through the integers from `1` to `i - 1` using a nested loop.
   - For each integer `j` in the range `[1, i - 1]`, calculate the maximum product for `i` by comparing:
     - The product of `j * (i - j)`, which represents breaking `i` into `j` and `(i - j)`.
     - The product of `j * dp[i - j]`, which represents breaking `i` into `j` and the maximum product for `(i - j)` (previously calculated).
   - Update `dp[i]` with the maximum value obtained from the above comparisons.

4. After completing the loops, `dp[n]` will contain the maximum product of integers obtained by breaking the input integer `n`.

5. Return `dp[n]` as the result.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `integerBreak` function:

```javascript
const n = 10;
const result = integerBreak(n);

console.log(`Maximum Product: ${result}`);
```

In this example, the `integerBreak` function is called with the input integer `10`. After processing, the function returns the maximum product, which is `36`.
