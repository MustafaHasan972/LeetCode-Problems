**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to find the maximum product of an integer `n` by breaking it into smaller positive integers.

**2. Initialization:**

- An array `dp` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` and filled with zeros. This array will be used to store the maximum products for integers from 1 to `n`.
- `dp[1]` is set to `1` since the maximum product of `1` is `1`.

**3. Dynamic Programming Loop:**

- The code uses a nested loop to iterate through integers from `2` to `n`.
- The outer loop, `for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++)`, iterates over each integer `i` from `2` to `n`.
- The inner loop, `for (let j = 1; j < i; j++)`, iterates over each integer `j` from `1` to `i - 1`.

**4. Calculate Maximum Product:**

- For each `i`, the code calculates the maximum product by considering two possibilities:
  - `j * (i - j)`: This represents the product of `j` and `(i - j)`. It means breaking `i` into `j` and `(i - j)` and multiplying them.
  - `j * dp[i - j]`: This represents the product of `j` and the maximum product for `(i - j)` calculated previously.
- The code uses `Math.max()` to choose the maximum value between these two possibilities and assigns it to `dp[i]`. This step ensures that `dp[i]` contains the maximum product for integer `i`.

**5. Return the Result:**

- After the dynamic programming loop is complete, the code returns `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum product of the integer `n` after breaking it into smaller positive integers.

**6. Example Outputs:**

- `console.log(integerBreak(2));` will output `1` since the maximum product of `2` is `1` (2 = 1 + 1).
- `console.log(integerBreak(10));` will output `36` since the maximum product of `10` is `36` (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).
