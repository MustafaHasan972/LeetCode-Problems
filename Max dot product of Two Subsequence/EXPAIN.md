**1. Problem Statement:**
The code aims to find the maximum dot product that can be obtained by selecting a subsequence of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` without changing the order of elements within each array.

**2. Initialize Variables:**

- `m` is assigned the length of the `nums1` array.
- `n` is assigned the length of the `nums2` array.
- Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` to store the maximum dot product. Initialize all values in `dp` to `-Infinity`.

**3. Dynamic Programming Loop:**

- Use nested loops to iterate through `i` from `1` to `m` and `j` from `1` to `n`. These loops represent the possible subsequences from `nums1` and `nums2`.

**4. Calculate Maximum Dot Product:**

- For each combination of `i` and `j`, calculate the maximum dot product as follows:
  - `nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1]`: Multiply the current elements from both arrays.
  - `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1]`: Extend the previous subsequence by including the current elements and adding their product to the previous maximum.
  - `dp[i - 1][j]`: Exclude the current element from `nums1` and keep the subsequence from `nums2`.
  - `dp[i][j - 1]`: Exclude the current element from `nums2` and keep the subsequence from `nums1`.
- The maximum of these four values is stored in `dp[i][j]`.

**5. Final Result:**

- After completing the dynamic programming loop, `dp[m][n]` contains the maximum dot product of the two arrays when considering all possible subsequences.

**6. Example Usage:**

- The code is tested with example arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
- In this example, `nums1 = [2, 3, -2, 4]` and `nums2 = [-1, 2, 0, 3]`.
- The maximum dot product for these arrays is calculated to be `18`.

**7. Output:**

- The code outputs the maximum dot product, which is `18`, when the example arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are used as input.
